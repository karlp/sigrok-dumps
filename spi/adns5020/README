ADNS5020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a capture of the communication between a Cypress
cy7c63813 and an Avago ADNS 5020 Optical Mouse sensor.

This is the internals of a fairly generic dell optical mouse.

It is not nearly a complete sample of what types of traffic are possible,
specifically, it doesn't include a capture of "Burst Mode" traffic, which the
mouse firmware doesn't appear to use, even though Avago "highly recommends"
that burst mode be used for all devices.



adns5020-cy7c63813_init.sr
-------------------------

Captures the traffic from power on of the device (usb plug in) for 1 second.
Traces the initialization and reset pins as well as some general traffic.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a generic logic8 clone, at 6Mhz.  (Avago documents
max speed as 1Mhz) (6Mhz to try and avoid catching any glitches on CS)

  Probe         Description
  ---------------------------------
  0	VDD	used to trigger sampling
  3	SDIO	Bidir, but we use the MOSI stack from SPI
  4	SCK	SPI clock.
  5	NCS	chip select
  6	NRESET	chip reset
  7     XY_LED	chip led control, not used by this configuration

Data
----

The sigrok command line used was:

sigrok-cli -d fx2lafw --config samplerate=6M --time 1s \
	-o adns5020-cy7c63813_init.sr -t VDD=r \
	--channels 3=SDIO,5=NCS,4=SCK,6=NRESET,7=XY_LED,0=VDD

-------------------------

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a generic logic8 clone, at 4Mhz.  (Avago documents
max speed as 1Mhz)

  Probe         Description
  ---------------------------------
  3	SDIO	Bidir, but we use the MOSI stack from SPI
  4	SCLK	SPI clock.
  5	CS	chip select, active low	

  The part has pins for reset and LED control, but those were not used
  in this particular device.

Data
----

The sigrok command line used was:

  sigrok-cli -d fx2lafw --config samplerate=4M --time 100ms \
	-o adns5020-cy7c63813.sr

The capture shows the controller continually (every 200us) checking the
product code and mode, then reading for any movement in the X and Y
directions.  This is... curious given what the datasheet for the part
recommends, but I guess it's simple and it works.
