Data
----

The sequence starts with reading the (undocumented) chip id register, 
then issues a soft reset, then a sequence of reads of various
configuration registers. Some configuration registers are re-written,
then a set of calibration data is written.  Finally, a process starts
reading some basic meter values every 500ms for a few iterations.
